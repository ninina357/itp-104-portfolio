      <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="body">
      <p>My website will be a portfolio, so it'll include my past work and some information about me</p>
      <p>Intended audience: Anyone who I want to see a selection of my work (family,employers, friends)</p>
      <p>I want my site to look simple, so my color scheme will mainly be muted/pastel purples,pinks and blues. For text I'll use black or white depending on what shows up better, and I want to have rounded edges as much as I can on things like buttons/photos.</p>
      <p>I liked the header, simple design, and fonts from <a href="http://304.itpwebdev.com/~projects/itp104/futo_wada/home.html">this past ITP 104 website</a></p>
      <p>I liked the color scheme of <a href="http://304.itpwebdev.com/~projects/itp104/portfolio_haerikim/home.html">this past ITP 104 website</a>, especially how the menu buttons look when hovered over</p>
      <p>I liked the home page of <a href="http://304.itpwebdev.com/~projects/itp104/sarmakesthings/assignment_08.html">this past ITP 104 website</a>, specifically the design of the menu</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Scope: I'm planning on having 1. A home page 2. A page to display writing projects 3. A plage to display multimedia projects 4. A page to display misc. projects 5. A page do display about information. There will be one other page, but it will be a coming soon page for data journalism projects and doesn't count</p>
